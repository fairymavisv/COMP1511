1. Functions:

    function: it is a way to break down our codes into smaller functional bits
        - performs some sort of operation
        - has inputs and an output
        - call function from anywhere in our code

    return type + name of function + (input / arguments) {
        return variable;
    }

2. Style:
    
    good style:
        - indentation and bracketing
        - names of variables and functions
        - structuring your code nesting, repetition
        - comments
        - consistency
    
    block of code surrounded by: indent 4 spaces

3. While vs For:

    while - dont know the number of iterations ahead of time
    For - know the number of iterations ahead of time

4. For Loop Structure:
```
for (int count = 0; // initialisation: executed before loop begins 
    count < 10; // expression: evaluated before each iteration, exits when falsel
    count ++ // increment: executed at the end of each iteration)
```

5. While Structure
```
int count = 0;
while ( count < 10) {
    count++;
}
```
