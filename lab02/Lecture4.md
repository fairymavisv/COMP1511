1. while(counter):

    loop counter: use variable to control how many times a loop runs

    int variable can be initialised outside the loop and updated inside the loop

2. while(sentinel):

    flag value: tells the loop when it can stop

    it's like an on/off switch for the loop, declared and set outside the loop and will be updated inside the loop

    it's termination condition can be checked in the while expression

3. while(condition):

    conditional looping: use condition to decide to exit a loop at any time

4. Struct:

    define the struct (outside the main)
    ```
    struct struct_name {
        date_type variable_name_member;
    }
    ```

    declare a struct ï¼ˆinside the main)
    ```
    struct struct_name variable_name;
    ```

    initialise a struct (inside the main)
    ```
    variable_name.variable_name_member;
    ```
